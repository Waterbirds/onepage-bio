			<h3> Castlepoint's Business Problem</h3>
			<p>
				For Castlepoint to apply the <b>correct regulations to document</b>, Castlepoint must 
				understand the <b>content of the documents</b>. This is complicated by the <b>size of the datasets</b> maintained by Castlepoint clients which is often in 
				the <b>Terabyte to Petabyte</b> range, as well as the many different combinations of topics stored within the datasets. <b>Extensive compute resources and 
				time</b> is required to understand the data at these scales.
	    		</p>
			<br>
			<h3> Internship Goal</h3>
			<p>	The goal of the internship project was to research and produce reports and implementations of various <b> Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b> 
		   	 	and <b> Machine Learning (ML)</b> models. Providing Castlepoint with the necessary information to make an informed decision, when choosing 
		    		which NLP & ML methods to implement into their SaaS records management product. Helping an organisation apply the correct rules, regulations, 
				and appropriate lifecycle controls to their record databases.

		  <ul>
  			<li>
          			Researched a multitude of natural language processing and key phrase extraction models. 
				Selecting the best models based on <b> speed, resource requirements and accuracy</b>. 
				Testing to ensure robustness against a variety of datasets including documents of different lengths and types.
    			</li>
			  <br>
  			<li>
          			Once selected implemented in<b>  Python</b> and containerised within a <b> Docker</b> image. Setup as an<b>  Application Programming Interface (API)</b>.
				Allowing for easy maintainability and scalability on cloud services such as <b> AWS & Microsoft Azure </b> or on-premise servers. 
  			</li>

		  	<li>
				<b>Reduced data required </b> for downstream classifcation tasks by up to <b>95%.</b>
				As well provides users with an <b> informative glimpse </b> into a document's topics.

		 <p> <b> Input </b> </p>
		 <p style="font-size:11px"> “Reboot ordered for EU patent law A European Parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions. The Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the Commission should re-submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it. It has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation. Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, "computer implemented invention". The draft law suffered setbacks when Poland, one of the largest EU member states, rejected its adoption twice in two months. Intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. Only two MEPs backed the draft law at the JURI meeting, with one voting to abstain. Opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the EU a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet busines methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its "one-click shopping" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.”
